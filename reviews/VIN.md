## Idea: Can this approach be applied to other algorithms. e.g. policy iteration

## Main points
* Value iteration can be modeled as convolutional networks
* One iteration corresponding to one pass. Transition is analog to convolutional weights. Max operation is analog to maxpooling.

## Experiments
* Simple gridworld and other more complex exp.
