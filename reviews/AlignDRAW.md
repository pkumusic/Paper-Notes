## Idea: Generate video from text?

## Main points
* AlignDRAW iteratively draws patches on a canvas while attending to the relevant words in the description
* Maximize a variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the correct iamge given input caption
## Experiments
* Datasets: MSCOCO, MNIST
* Baselines: DRAW, skipthoughtDRAW, LAPGAN, Convolutional-Deconvolutional VAE
* Evaluation Method: Retrival and image similarity
